# JEM_Game
This is a simple extension of the classical game "Wolf und Schafe" (Fuchs und GÃ¤nse). The game is about a bitter war of sheep versus wolves.
## Normal Game Mode
The sheep are only safe if they fill the stable up to 8 sheep, while the goal of the wolves is eating 13 of 20 sheep first.
The player of the sheep has the first turn. Sheep are not allowed to move backwards and they can jumpy only one field at each turn. Contrary, the wolves are allowed to move in every direction along the grid lines. If there is a sheep in front of a wolf and the tile behind the sheep is empty, the wolf can start his attack move. While jumping over it, the wolf is able to kill the sheep.
